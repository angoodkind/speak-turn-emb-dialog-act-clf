39|E002|S003|E002-subject1-1|prompt1|1|Hi Pat! Some of my favorites are 500 Days of Summer, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Love Actually, or really any silly comedy movies. I usually prefer TV to movies because I have a terrible attention span.|1642089235081|Statement-non-opinion
40|E002|S003|E002-subject1-2|prompt1|1|So I like more indie films or dumb raunchy comedy.|1642089262090|Statement-non-opinion
41|E002|S004|E002-subject2-15|prompt1|2|Are there any genres for either TV or movies that you just have no interest in?|1642089299092|Yes-No-Question
42|E002|S003|E002-subject1-3|prompt1|1|I don't care for most sci-fi or fantasy, and don't really like any movies that feature war in the middle east. I can tolerate some action films but they're not my favorite.|1642089356748|Statement-non-opinion
43|E002|S004|E002-subject2-16|prompt1|2|Silly comedies are pretty breezy watches. I know you've had a long week at work, so I recommend some older and modern TV staples. The first is The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. It's a bit dated but it's still one of those shows that while it handles serious issues from time to time, still is a pleasant watch and furthermore, has good rewatchability. I also recommend Roseanne for the same reason. A current example is How I Met Your Mother. It's a TV show that ended not too long ago but has become a favorite over the years. The episodes just fly by and the first episode is a pretty fair indicator of what to expect from the rest of the series. So there's no real attachment in case you don't like it.|1642089532746|Statement-non-opinion
44|E002|S004|E002-subject2-17|prompt1|2|For dumb raunchy comedy movies, Jim Carrey is a goldmine for this. The Mask, which is a little bit darker, is a good watch. Dumb and Dumber as well as Ace Ventura also are just flat out classics that, while unbelievably goofy, are just so entertaining.|1642089585315|Statement-opinion
45|E002|S003|E002-subject1-4|prompt1|1|Good recommendations! I have watched How I Met Your Mother and enjoyed it, but I haven't tried Fresh Prince yet. I'll have to put it on sometime! I was a little young when it was first on. |1642089589157|Statement-non-opinion
46|E002|S003|E002-subject1-5|prompt2|1|Love Jim Carrey! |1642089602999|Conventional-closing
47|E002|S003|E002-subject1-6|prompt2|1|How about you- what are some of your favorites? How do you feel about documentaries or docu-dramas?|1642089626943|Open-Question
48|E002|S004|E002-subject2-18|prompt2|2|Documentaries are good, but I have to be in the mood for them. Some of my favorite movie subjects are comedies, dramas, I can roll with romance, but I absolutely adore John Hughes style coming-of-age movies. For TV shows, I'm big into House, Roseanne, HIMYM, and Top Gear among others.|1642089701068|Statement-non-opinion
49|E002|S003|E002-subject1-7|prompt2|1|If the mood strikes you, one of my favorite new series has been Dopesick. It's a dramatized retelling of the story of Oxycontin and it has an excellent cast. I was hooked from the start- it's heavy but it's really good. Since you mentioned House- maybe you would enjoy Dr. Death! It's the true story of a surgeon who maimed/killed many of his patients and how it was allowed to happen.  As far as comedies go, one I've really enjoyed recently was A.P. Bio. It's hilarious and really hits a stride in the first two seasons. I'm assuming you've seen Seinfeld, but if you haven't, it might be right up your alley too. |1642089902130|Statement-non-opinion
50|E002|S003|E002-subject1-8|prompt2|1|I don't have a lot of suggestions for coming of age films- I just haven't seen that many.|1642089916464|Statement-non-opinion
51|E002|S003|E002-subject1-9|prompt2|1|Lady Bird was actually a fun coming of age film, I really enjoy Saoirse Ronan|1642089953136|Statement-non-opinion
52|E002|S004|E002-subject2-19|prompt2|2|I watched the pilot of Seinfeld and thought it was okay. Didn't finish that episode, but I have just heard so much about it. And funnily enough, while I haven't seen Dr. Death, I have an idea of who that was about assuming it's the same person. Watched a Youtube video about it.|1642089969255|Statement-non-opinion
53|E002|S004|E002-subject2-20|prompt2|2|Maybe AP Bio could work, especially considering I took such a subject in high school. Maybe I'll relate to it.|1642090001737|Statement-opinion
54|E002|S003|E002-subject1-10|prompt2|1|The Dr. Death series is on Hulu and it was pretty well done! It jumps around a bit in the timeline but it does a decent job telling the story. |1642090007833|Statement-non-opinion
55|E002|S004|E002-subject2-21|prompt2|2|I would really have to be in the mood, but never say never.|1642090037541|Statement-non-opinion
56|E002|S003|E002-subject1-11|prompt2|1|AP Bio stars Glenn Howerton from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He does a great job. If you haven't checked that show out, maybe you'd like that one. It's very raunchy/mean humor. Basically a show about terrible people being terrible- super entertaining and they do not hold back.|1642090063849|Statement-non-opinion

399|E010|S020|E010-subject2-5|prompt1|2|Sometimes trash TV can be relaxing. Something incredibly vacuous like Selling Sunset requires no mental effort to watch and provides some escapism.|1642610542691|Statement-opinion
400|E010|S019|E010-subject1-1|prompt1|1|I completely agree, when I want to relax and decompress from the day I think something that doesn't require much attention and brain power is my go-to. I've never seen Selling Sunset but it is on my list  |1642610631443|Statement-non-opinion
401|E010|S020|E010-subject2-6|prompt1|2|It's silly and slightly obnoxious but it's something you can switch off and binge. On the other hand, you can also get some respite from completely immersing yourself in a show - some of the Netflix-produced documentaries are really absorbing and hold your attention well, so it distracts you from whatever work struggles or other life stress for a while.|1642610756984|Statement-opinion
402|E010|S020|E010-subject2-7|prompt1|2|Netflix has mastered the art of documentary storytelling, I think. They know how to deliver some twists and turns. |1642610790270|Statement-opinion
403|E010|S019|E010-subject1-2|prompt1|1|They really have, I've been binging the Netflix documentary Cheer lately. Even though I've never been a cheerleader and have no attachment to the sport, the show is so captivating and does a great job telling the story. |1642610874075|Statement-non-opinion
404|E010|S020|E010-subject2-8|prompt2|2|Oh! I totally binged Cheer too! Season 2 has been so interesting because as well as being a documentary about cheerleading, it's also now a documentary about the consequences of making a documentary about cheerleading. I was intrigued by the number of parents who got their kid an agent|1642610948272|Statement-non-opinion
405|E010|S019|E010-subject1-3|prompt2|1|Yes me too! Changing the pace a little bit, there are so many shows I could recommend for something more thought-provoking. I love being able to escape from real life for a bit so I enjoy watching shows with intense plot lines. Right now I am watching the show Mindhunter on Netflix, but it is very dark so if you'd like something lighter I would recommend Umbrella Academy. The Umbrella Academy does a fantastic job at balancing action and heavy plot lines with light-hearted humor.  |1642611205867|Statement-non-opinion
406|E010|S020|E010-subject2-9|prompt2|2|Mindhunter was intense! I enjoyed watching but it was a little draining somehow. I've been meaning to watch Umbrella Academy and just haven't gotten around to it. I generally love anything derived from a comic book. Obviously the Marvel universe stuff is really well executed but there have been other good comic movies/tv too|1642611379929|Statement-non-opinion

414|E011|S021|E011-subject1-2|prompt1|1|I ask because most of the time, if I want to relax I'll try and watch shows or movies I've seen a couple times before, that way I don't have to pay attention |1642610960537|Statement-non-opinion

1029|E027|S054|E027-subject2-25|prompt1|2|It definitely is an interesting plot. No, I am not much of a book reader. I have tried in the past to go back and read books of shows I liked (Game of Thrones) and I end up losing interest. I heard the books were really good for the Expanse too. It is actually what got me to watch the show.|1643395096886|Statement-non-opinion

1037|E027|S054|E027-subject2-29|prompt2|2|That's a long time away unfortunately. I know Disney has a few Star-Wars shows coming out but I am not sure if that is sci-fi enough.|1643395299236|Statement-non-opinion

3186|E071|S141|E071-subject1-14|prompt1|1|I have not seen it, but heard its great|1644947376371|Statement-non-opinion

3188|E071|S142|E071-subject2-42|prompt1|2|Ok there's one - it's incredibly worth it, very tight, very fun, and because it's (pseudo) real, it really wraps you up|1644947416330|Statement-opinion
3189|E071|S141|E071-subject1-16|prompt1|1|what about Downton Abbey, is that worth watching?|1644947432861|Open-Question
3190|E071|S142|E071-subject2-43|prompt2|2|I LOVED the first season or two, watched them several times - fantastic. But then I felt the show writers kind of went off the rails with trying to make it interesting.|1644947473395|Statement-non-opinion
3191|E071|S141|E071-subject1-17|prompt2|1|That seems to be a common problem |1644947487901|Statement-opinion

3193|E071|S142|E071-subject2-44|prompt2|2|Yeah. Milking it a bit long, or trying to be interesting for interesting's sake|1644947504385|Agree/Accept
3194|E071|S142|E071-subject2-45|prompt2|2|"THAT WAS MY EXACT THOUGHT JUST NOW - I can't get invested if you insist on killing every character for ""shock"" value or whatever"|1644947526441|Statement-opinion
3195|E071|S142|E071-subject2-46|prompt2|2|by GoT season 5 or 6, I was wondering, why do I care about these characters anymore?|1644947552769|Statement-non-opinion

3197|E071|S141|E071-subject1-19|prompt2|1|Well, based on what you've told me , I would recommend Sopranos, as it sort of set the template for the anti hero, prestige drama that is now so popular |1644947625149|Statement-opinion
3198|E071|S141|E071-subject1-20|prompt2|1|Everything from Mad men, sons of anarchy, breaking bad, etc. owes its lineage to that |1644947646956|Statement-opinion
3199|E071|S142|E071-subject2-48|prompt2|2|I've never watched it - it seems to be almost Shakespeare level of referencing in pop-culture... I could get something from it|1644947689555|Statement-non-opinion
3200|E071|S142|E071-subject2-49|prompt2|2|were you ok with the ending? (I'm not familiar with it, just want to know if I'll be let down haha)|1644947704617|Yes-No-Question
3201|E071|S141|E071-subject1-21|prompt2|1|Honestly, people were pissed at the time, but it aged well in my opinion, and is in keeping w/ the show's overall theme |1644947730277|Statement-opinion
3202|E071|S141|E071-subject1-22|prompt2|1|its not a bad ending like GoT was |1644947735711|Statement-non-opinion
3203|E071|S141|E071-subject1-23|prompt2|1|where the writers just said fuck it, we're already working on a different show|1644947746792|Statement-non-opinion

3207|E071|S142|E071-subject2-51|prompt2|2|I think Mad Men and Breaking Bad both did endings really well (though BB was meh for a bit there near the end)|1644947780732|Statement-opinion
3208|E071|S142|E071-subject2-52|prompt2|2|re: references, yes, everything makes so much more sense now...|1644947794110|Statement-opinion
3209|E071|S141|E071-subject1-26|prompt2|1|I think HBO does a good job of using a certain setting/ motif as a vehicle for all sorts of discussion and exploration|1644947826629|Statement-opinion
3210|E071|S141|E071-subject1-27|prompt2|1|so the Sopranos is obviously a violent mob drama on the surface|1644947839330|Statement-opinion

3216|E071|S141|E071-subject1-31|prompt2|1|whereas netflix is mostly just temporarily licensing expensive properties that eventually go away|1644947914377|Statement-non-opinion
3217|E071|S142|E071-subject2-55|prompt2|2|I think ATT owns them for now too, so maybe I can get that with my internet now... hmmm, will check|1644947926166|Statement-non-opinion
3218|E072|S144|E072-subject2-22|prompt1|2|"I would recommend the shows ""You"" and ""Dark"" on Netflix. I think they are both very entertaining and worth sinking  a bunch of  time into. "|1644947058687|Statement-non-opinion

4787|E101|S202|E101-subject2-31|prompt2|2|Is that the one about the Royal family?|1644429381430|Yes-No-Question
4788|E101|S201|E101-subject1-10|prompt2|1|It is a very interesting show that is essentially about the royal family with Queen Elizabeth and Princess Diana, but it shows the more sensitive and personal side of the family.|1644429397026|Statement-opinion
4789|E101|S201|E101-subject1-11|prompt2|1|It goes in depth into their lives, more than what the public sees.|1644429423568|Statement-opinion

4791|E101|S201|E101-subject1-12|prompt2|1|I was pleasantly surprised watching The Crown too. I don't have that much of an interest in the royal family, but it was interesting to see that side of them.|1644429472125|Statement-non-opinion

4795|E101|S202|E101-subject2-35|prompt2|2|Oh, I didn't realize that. I thought she felt they didn't portray her well. |1644429612139|Statement-non-opinion
4796|E101|S201|E101-subject1-14|prompt2|1|I think that is what happened. In the show she was super mean to Princess Diana and other people. Maybe she didn't like the show revealing her in a bad light.|1644429652072|Statement-opinion
