E001|S002|E001-subject2-36|prompt2|2|I still haven't started|1642088220616|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-12|prompt1|2|"Hey there! What are some ""comfort food"" movies for you?"|1642089169265|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-13|prompt1|2|Ones you can watch at any point?|1642089173863|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-14|prompt1|2|Are you there?\|1642089228549|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-1|prompt1|1|Hi Pat! Some of my favorites are 500 Days of Summer, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Love Actually, or really any silly comedy movies. I usually prefer TV to movies because I have a terrible attention span.|1642089235081|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-2|prompt1|1|So I like more indie films or dumb raunchy comedy.|1642089262090|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-15|prompt1|2|Are there any genres for either TV or movies that you just have no interest in?|1642089299092|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-3|prompt1|1|I don't care for most sci-fi or fantasy, and don't really like any movies that feature war in the middle east. I can tolerate some action films but they're not my favorite.|1642089356748|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-16|prompt1|2|Silly comedies are pretty breezy watches. I know you've had a long week at work, so I recommend some older and modern TV staples. The first is The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. It's a bit dated but it's still one of those shows that while it handles serious issues from time to time, still is a pleasant watch and furthermore, has good rewatchability. I also recommend Roseanne for the same reason. A current example is How I Met Your Mother. It's a TV show that ended not too long ago but has become a favorite over the years. The episodes just fly by and the first episode is a pretty fair indicator of what to expect from the rest of the series. So there's no real attachment in case you don't like it.|1642089532746|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-17|prompt1|2|For dumb raunchy comedy movies, Jim Carrey is a goldmine for this. The Mask, which is a little bit darker, is a good watch. Dumb and Dumber as well as Ace Ventura also are just flat out classics that, while unbelievably goofy, are just so entertaining.|1642089585315|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-4|prompt1|1|Good recommendations! I have watched How I Met Your Mother and enjoyed it, but I haven't tried Fresh Prince yet. I'll have to put it on sometime! I was a little young when it was first on. |1642089589157|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-5|prompt2|1|Love Jim Carrey! |1642089602999|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-6|prompt2|1|How about you- what are some of your favorites? How do you feel about documentaries or docu-dramas?|1642089626943|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-18|prompt2|2|Documentaries are good, but I have to be in the mood for them. Some of my favorite movie subjects are comedies, dramas, I can roll with romance, but I absolutely adore John Hughes style coming-of-age movies. For TV shows, I'm big into House, Roseanne, HIMYM, and Top Gear among others.|1642089701068|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-7|prompt2|1|If the mood strikes you, one of my favorite new series has been Dopesick. It's a dramatized retelling of the story of Oxycontin and it has an excellent cast. I was hooked from the start- it's heavy but it's really good. Since you mentioned House- maybe you would enjoy Dr. Death! It's the true story of a surgeon who maimed/killed many of his patients and how it was allowed to happen.  As far as comedies go, one I've really enjoyed recently was A.P. Bio. It's hilarious and really hits a stride in the first two seasons. I'm assuming you've seen Seinfeld, but if you haven't, it might be right up your alley too. |1642089902130|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-8|prompt2|1|I don't have a lot of suggestions for coming of age films- I just haven't seen that many.|1642089916464|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-9|prompt2|1|Lady Bird was actually a fun coming of age film, I really enjoy Saoirse Ronan|1642089953136|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-19|prompt2|2|I watched the pilot of Seinfeld and thought it was okay. Didn't finish that episode, but I have just heard so much about it. And funnily enough, while I haven't seen Dr. Death, I have an idea of who that was about assuming it's the same person. Watched a Youtube video about it.|1642089969255|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-20|prompt2|2|Maybe AP Bio could work, especially considering I took such a subject in high school. Maybe I'll relate to it.|1642090001737|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-10|prompt2|1|The Dr. Death series is on Hulu and it was pretty well done! It jumps around a bit in the timeline but it does a decent job telling the story. |1642090007833|DA
E002|S004|E002-subject2-21|prompt2|2|I would really have to be in the mood, but never say never.|1642090037541|DA
E002|S003|E002-subject1-11|prompt2|1|AP Bio stars Glenn Howerton from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He does a great job. If you haven't checked that show out, maybe you'd like that one. It's very raunchy/mean humor. Basically a show about terrible people being terrible- super entertaining and they do not hold back.|1642090063849|DA
E003|S005|E003-subject1-1|prompt1|1|i'm alex and you're Pat I believe|1642089317404|DA

E003|S005|E003-subject1-2|prompt1|1|I like romantic comedies, some action and movies that are a little quirky|1642089344285|DA
E003|S006|E003-subject2-53|prompt1|2|Speilberg's West Side Story is amazing |1642089368045|DA

E008|S015|E008-subject1-8|prompt2|1|If you have seen the other Matrix movies, it's worth it to see. I feel it wasn't a needed movie but it was fun to watch |1642089672717|DA

E009|S017|E009-subject1-12|prompt2|1|That was a drama too|1642612358588|DA

E009|S018|E009-subject2-34|prompt2|2|my favorite is banshee though|1642612402909|DA
E009|S018|E009-subject2-35|prompt2|2|ever heard of it|1642612421790|DA
E009|S017|E009-subject1-13|prompt2|1|No. Is it more of a drama?|1642612429890|DA
E009|S018|E009-subject2-36|prompt2|2|drama action|1642612445953|DA
E009|S017|E009-subject1-14|prompt2|1|It is American made or outside the U.S.?|1642612499170|DA

E009|S018|E009-subject2-39|prompt2|2|on cinemax|1642612534379|DA
E009|S017|E009-subject1-15|prompt2|1|That sounds good. Is there anyone in it that I might know?|1642612551171|DA
E009|S018|E009-subject2-40|prompt2|2|nobody too famous but great actors and great script writing|1642612595657|DA
E009|S018|E009-subject2-41|prompt2|2|well shot too not cheap by any means|1642612618811|DA
E010|S020|E010-subject2-5|prompt1|2|Sometimes trash TV can be relaxing. Something incredibly vacuous like Selling Sunset requires no mental effort to watch and provides some escapism.|1642610542691|DA
E010|S019|E010-subject1-1|prompt1|1|I completely agree, when I want to relax and decompress from the day I think something that doesn't require much attention and brain power is my go-to. I've never seen Selling Sunset but it is on my list  |1642610631443|DA
E010|S020|E010-subject2-6|prompt1|2|It's silly and slightly obnoxious but it's something you can switch off and binge. On the other hand, you can also get some respite from completely immersing yourself in a show - some of the Netflix-produced documentaries are really absorbing and hold your attention well, so it distracts you from whatever work struggles or other life stress for a while.|1642610756984|DA
E010|S020|E010-subject2-7|prompt1|2|Netflix has mastered the art of documentary storytelling, I think. They know how to deliver some twists and turns. |1642610790270|DA
E010|S019|E010-subject1-2|prompt1|1|They really have, I've been binging the Netflix documentary Cheer lately. Even though I've never been a cheerleader and have no attachment to the sport, the show is so captivating and does a great job telling the story. |1642610874075|DA
E010|S020|E010-subject2-8|prompt2|2|Oh! I totally binged Cheer too! Season 2 has been so interesting because as well as being a documentary about cheerleading, it's also now a documentary about the consequences of making a documentary about cheerleading. I was intrigued by the number of parents who got their kid an agent|1642610948272|DA
E010|S019|E010-subject1-3|prompt2|1|Yes me too! Changing the pace a little bit, there are so many shows I could recommend for something more thought-provoking. I love being able to escape from real life for a bit so I enjoy watching shows with intense plot lines. Right now I am watching the show Mindhunter on Netflix, but it is very dark so if you'd like something lighter I would recommend Umbrella Academy. The Umbrella Academy does a fantastic job at balancing action and heavy plot lines with light-hearted humor.  |1642611205867|DA
E010|S020|E010-subject2-9|prompt2|2|Mindhunter was intense! I enjoyed watching but it was a little draining somehow. I've been meaning to watch Umbrella Academy and just haven't gotten around to it. I generally love anything derived from a comic book. Obviously the Marvel universe stuff is really well executed but there have been other good comic movies/tv too|1642611379929|DA
E010|S019|E010-subject1-4|prompt2|1|Ahhhh yes, so many new Marvel series on DisneyPlus!|1642611413902|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-19|prompt1|2|I would reccomend some simple shows like Family guy or the simpsons as they dont require much attention and are very good to unwind and relax with|1642610682282|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-20|prompt1|2|Most of the time. I also watch some Animes when I want to be more attentive|1642610768057|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-21|prompt1|2|Thats a good idea|1642610792952|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-22|prompt1|2|I do that sometimes too|1642610798079|DA
E011|S021|E011-subject1-1|prompt1|1|That sounds good. are those what you watch to relax?|1642610905392|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-23|prompt1|2|When I want background noise Im normally doing work so Ill watch something that doesnt need my full attention|1642610910923|DA
E011|S021|E011-subject1-2|prompt1|1|I ask because most of the time, if I want to relax I'll try and watch shows or movies I've seen a couple times before, that way I don't have to pay attention |1642610960537|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-24|prompt1|2|Ive rewatched the office a fair share of times|1642610970454|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-25|prompt1|2|normally its comedy shows|1642610981497|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-26|prompt1|2|yeah exactly|1642611025210|DA
E011|S021|E011-subject1-3|prompt1|1|I feel like if I haven't seen it before, I'm more likely to pay attention, when sometimes, i just want background noise|1642611031713|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-27|prompt1|2|Things like action shows need way more attention|1642611041865|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-28|prompt1|2|Yeah they can be distracting|1642611083245|DA
E011|S021|E011-subject1-4|prompt1|1|Exactly. |1642611114064|DA

E011|S021|E011-subject1-9|prompt2|1|I feel like horror movies are usually a little move intense when it comes to mental stimulation. |1642611342759|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-37|prompt2|2|Yeah they make it so obvious|1642611345625|DA
E011|S021|E011-subject1-10|prompt2|1|I watched The Ritual a couple months ago on netflix and it wasn't super scary but definitely kept you interested |1642611392247|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-38|prompt2|2|I feel like thats a lame excuse cause horror has basically limitless potential |1642611412601|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-39|prompt2|2|like sometimes the villain isnt evn a person|1642611423015|DA
E011|S021|E011-subject1-11|prompt2|1|Yea it was cool because at no point did I really know where the movie was going and usually I'm pretty good at guessing|1642611450206|DA
E011|S022|E011-subject2-40|prompt2|2|"Yeah like ""dude who is socially awkward and always seems ike he wants to kill people"" gets old after a while"|1642611503010|DA

E011|S022|E011-subject2-42|prompt2|2|Something crazy|1642611548748|DA
E011|S021|E011-subject1-14|prompt2|1|i guess people run out of unique ideas so they just repackage the same scary movie over and over again |1642611555294|DA
E011|S021|E011-subject1-15|prompt2|1|thats what i think!|1642611610117|DA
E011|S021|E011-subject1-16|prompt2|1|its so weird that you get the same movie so many times when you can literally make up bad guys so easily |1642611635822|DA

E012|S023|E012-subject1-2|prompt1|1|I actually have not seen it yet. Do you know if it is any good? Do you know if it is more serious or funny?|1642611067080|DA
E012|S024|E012-subject2-23|prompt1|2|It is more of a meaningful movie!! I enjoyed watching it-- especially listening to the songs|1642611080336|DA
E012|S023|E012-subject1-3|prompt1|1|Oh, I like it when movies have meaning and lessons can be learned. I do not doubt that the songs are very high quality. Is there another movie or TV show you would recommend? I like comedy and dramas.|1642611186383|DA
E012|S024|E012-subject2-24|prompt1|2|Hmmm, I would say Superbad is great if you prefer comedies. For drama, I'd reccommend something classic like the Titanic. Have you seen either of those?|1642611235646|DA

E012|S023|E012-subject1-5|prompt1|1|I probably have seen rom-coms and didn't realize they fall into that genre. I'm not sure of a recommendation. I don't think The Office would count|1642611387057|DA

E012|S023|E012-subject1-8|prompt2|1|I definitely will check it out.|1642611490006|DA
E012|S023|E012-subject1-9|prompt2|1|Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy? That's a stimulating movie for sure.|1642611511818|DA
E012|S024|E012-subject2-31|prompt2|2|I have, but I prefer something more action-packed like End Game or Iron Man. Have you seen the show Wanda Vision|1642611522307|DA

E012|S024|E012-subject2-33|prompt2|2|You convinced me to make it my next movie to watch!|1642611731657|DA

E013|S026|E013-subject2-11|prompt1|2|It really depends on the type of show/movie you would like to watch. If you want a good drama, watch Grey's Anatomy or Breaking Bad. Those are two of my favorites. If you want something relaxing, you can go with a classic comedy such as Happy Gilmore or Grown Ups. I like Marvel movies a lot as well.|1642611092319|DA
E013|S025|E013-subject1-2|prompt1|1|I am a big Breaking Bad fan and have seen the entire series. |1642611121861|DA

E013|S025|E013-subject1-8|prompt1|1|I have liked The Office, How I Met Your Mother, Brooklyn 99, and Parks and Recreation|1642611395528|DA
E013|S026|E013-subject2-14|prompt2|2|They're all good shows, I watched the office for a little but never fully got into it. I'm not a huge tv person |1642611430950|DA

E014|S028|E014-subject2-9|prompt1|2|After a long week, I love watching movies and TV shows that distract me from reality. I highly recommend some early 2000s sitcoms or rom-coms! They're funny and relatively short and don't require you to pay much attention to understand what's going on.|1642611104824|DA
E014|S028|E014-subject2-10|prompt1|2|What kind of movies do you like?|1642611126033|DA
E014|S028|E014-subject2-11|prompt1|2|Are you there?|1642611149793|DA

E014|S028|E014-subject2-14|prompt1|2|I like Friends too, but I absolutely hate It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. The characters on that show aren't very relatable for me and I just can't watch it. Why do you like it?|1642611440074|DA
E014|S027|E014-subject1-5|prompt2|1|If I were to reccomend a thought-provoking show I would recommend a mystery show like Elementary or a show that is based off of real events like Narcos. Or another option would be any documentary series. |1642611591344|DA
E014|S028|E014-subject2-15|prompt2|2|Interesting! I haven't seen either of those shows, but I do really like documentaries. True-crime is my favorite. What kind of documentaries do you enjoy?|1642611633794|DA
E014|S027|E014-subject1-6|prompt2|1|I enjoy true-crime too but sometimes the stories are too freaky/ scary for me to watch! I enjoy documentaries on historical events and social phenomena. I enjoy watching documentaries where I can really learn something from them.|1642611737220|DA
E014|S028|E014-subject2-16|prompt2|2|Ohhh yeah! There was one about social media recently that I really enjoyed but I can't remember what it was called. |1642611791851|DA
E014|S028|E014-subject2-17|prompt2|2|Do you like movies that cover those same topics as well?|1642611806251|DA
E014|S027|E014-subject1-7|prompt2|1|Sounds interesting! And yeah I do but I have not watched any recently. |1642611917156|DA
E014|S028|E014-subject2-18|prompt2|2|Inception might be one of my favorite movies that kind of makes you really think about what reality really is|1642611957024|DA
E014|S027|E014-subject1-8|prompt2|1|Yeah I actually enjoyed that movie! I watched it for the first time this past summer and it was a really captivating storyline.|1642612005236|DA
E015|S029|E015-subject1-1|prompt1|1|I like horror, suspense, thriller, action, and comedy movies. I enjoy reality TV the most. What do you like?|1642611284640|DA
E015|S030|E015-subject2-7|prompt1|2|Hello! I like horror in theory, but usually am too wimpy to watch scary movies. I tend to watch things already relevant to my interests or that I already know a bit about. For example, adaptations of games or books.|1642611380320|DA
E015|S029|E015-subject1-2|prompt1|1|I enjoy those types of movies/shows! I actually play games as well, so I love anything based off gaming. I enjoy the superhero/villian movies and shows as well.|1642611476578|DA
E015|S030|E015-subject2-8|prompt1|2|I just finished Arcane a few days ago and was really impressed, despite not having any prior knowledge to the universe or story. I'd say there's a decent amount of suspense and action.|1642611558835|DA
E015|S030|E015-subject2-9|prompt1|2|I also finished Dexter: New Blood, but I'd only recommend that if you were familiar with the base show. Horror themes, but plenty of suspense and action as well.|1642611592120|DA
E015|S029|E015-subject1-3|prompt2|1|I will definetly look into that one, I have not heard of it. I just finished Dexter too! I was really disappointed with the ending.|1642611669959|DA
E015|S030|E015-subject2-10|prompt2|2|Yeah...I was as well. It was fun for the most part, at least.|1642611708366|DA
E015|S030|E015-subject2-11|prompt2|2|I think I generally stick to what is popular, or what my friends enjoy. I don't usually branch out or browse for things on my own.|1642611754431|DA
E015|S029|E015-subject1-4|prompt2|1|One of my favorite movies I recently watched was Ready Player One. Its based off of virtual reality and I really enjoyed that.|1642611794908|DA
E015|S030|E015-subject2-12|prompt2|2|Ooh! I've heard of it, the movie and the book. Unfortunately the most I've gleaned through osmosis is memes about its quality, but the premise sounds fun.|1642611829950|DA
E015|S029|E015-subject1-5|prompt2|1|It was super enjoyable! Im usually good at naming movies and shows, but now that I am on the spot, my mind is blank.|1642611940050|DA
E015|S030|E015-subject2-13|prompt2|2|That's alright. I watch few movies, I think within the last 3 or even 5 years the only movies I actually went out of my way to watch were either something Marvel or Detective Pikachu.|1642611992274|DA
E015|S030|E015-subject2-14|prompt2|2|I think the only things currently on my show queue are the second seasons of The Witcher, and Umbrella Academy.|1642612040876|DA

E021|S042|E021-subject2-13|prompt1|2|Hey Alex.  I read that you would like to watch a movie or Television show.|1643129333414|DA
E021|S041|E021-subject1-1|prompt1|1|I like Sci Fy and Fantasy movies and shows a lot.  Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter movies.  The Witcher now on Netflix and the Marvel movies. |1643129367591|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-14|prompt1|2|Nice.  I really, love the Sci-Fi and Fantasy genre as well.|1643129395991|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-15|prompt1|2|Star Wars were the first films I loved as a child.|1643129411813|DA
E021|S041|E021-subject1-2|prompt1|1|What are the ones you might recommend?|1643129416047|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-16|prompt1|2|A GREAT recent-ish Sci-Fi film is Interstellar|1643129444302|DA
E021|S041|E021-subject1-3|prompt1|1|Have not seen Intersellar, was on my list but frgot about in during COVID.|1643129485761|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-17|prompt1|2|It is a wonderful movie, in the tradition of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but maybe a little more complicated.|1643129530142|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-18|prompt1|2|It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon.|1643129546742|DA
E021|S041|E021-subject1-4|prompt1|1|I found 2001 a bit excessive and long.  Not my top sci fy movie.|1643129567930|DA
E021|S041|E021-subject1-5|prompt1|1|I often do like Matt Damon movie so that is a plus.|1643129606050|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-19|prompt1|2|This one is also long, but more modern and quick paced.|1643129610527|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-20|prompt1|2|2001 is a little more abstract.|1643129625935|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-21|prompt1|2|I will say, Interstellar is relatively complicated to follow in parts, because they used real science and math to explain the situations they find themselves in.|1643129679822|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-22|prompt1|2|But you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand it.  I'm certainly not a Rocket scientist!|1643129711598|DA
E021|S041|E021-subject1-6|prompt2|1|I will put Intersellar back on my list assuming its available for streaming somewhere that I have already.  I am an Engineer so I am good with actual science and math in shows.|1643129736889|DA
E021|S041|E021-subject1-7|prompt2|1|Any others?|1643129746435|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-23|prompt2|2|I also thought Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock was pretty good.  |1643129778678|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-24|prompt2|2|Another space thriller, but maybe a little less theoretical and more dramatic and suspensful.|1643129806640|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-25|prompt2|2|It was released around the same year as Interstellar.|1643129826149|DA
E021|S041|E021-subject1-8|prompt2|1|Do you know if Gravity is streaming somewhere?  I remember hearing about it but that is about all.|1643129841745|DA

E021|S042|E021-subject2-31|prompt2|2|I believe Sandra Bullock won an oscar for Gravity but I am not entirely sure.|1643130079454|DA
E021|S041|E021-subject1-10|prompt2|1|They both sound good.  I do like it when I am not thinking about how things don't work the way they show it in the movies.|1643130094374|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-32|prompt2|2|Especially if you're just looking to sit back and relax and be entertained.|1643130122165|DA
E021|S042|E021-subject2-33|prompt2|2|George Clooney is also in Gravity and does well.|1643130151422|DA

E023|S045|E023-subject1-5|prompt1|1|Never heard of that one.|1643129715842|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-27|prompt1|2|I'm not familiar with The Resident|1643129716084|DA

E023|S046|E023-subject2-33|prompt1|2|I'm pretty sure it's on Hulu right now, |1643129842388|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-34|prompt1|2|My cousin just binged it during the pandemic and said it holds up, so it shouldnt feel too dated|1643129866075|DA
E023|S045|E023-subject1-10|prompt1|1|I tried Nip/Tuck last night, but it's just too seedy and weird for me. None of the characters are likeable.|1643129903427|DA

E023|S045|E023-subject1-13|prompt2|1|Thanks for the recommendation! Know of any good thrillers/horror?|1643130037604|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-37|prompt2|2|I haven't watched much horror, just the old ones like Halloween and Elm st.|1643130061225|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-38|prompt2|2|I did watch that one with sandra bullock though last year or 2 years ago|1643130077412|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-39|prompt2|2|Bird Box, I think it was called|1643130093997|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-40|prompt2|2|better than I expected, pretty tense|1643130101469|DA

E023|S045|E023-subject1-17|prompt2|1|If you liked that you may like the ones with John Krasinski. trying to remember the name. The sequel just released within th elast year-year and a half I think?|1643130261829|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-41|prompt2|2|is it horror or thriller?|1643130276910|DA

E023|S045|E023-subject1-18|prompt2|1|A quiet place is the name. Yep, he's really great in it.|1643130323052|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-43|prompt2|2|OH, yeah, I just saw an ad for that|1643130328380|DA

E023|S046|E023-subject2-46|prompt2|2|"Are they all called ""A Quiet Place"" or have it in the name"|1643130395355|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-47|prompt2|2|I'll have to look them up|1643130401614|DA
E023|S046|E023-subject2-48|prompt2|2|I like slower, quieter stuff, so that might be good|1643130412577|DA
E023|S045|E023-subject1-20|prompt2|1|So you're looking for something stimulating. Again I'd definitely reccommend A quiet place. It's so intense.|1643130426639|DA
E024|S047|E024-subject1-1|prompt1|1|I'm doing well. But have had a long week at work and would like to watch a movie or tv show to unwind.|1643394571682|DA
E024|S047|E024-subject1-2|prompt1|1|I like thrillers (nothing too scary tho!!) and documentaries, but I think something more lowkey and chill rn so I don't have to use my brain as much lol|1643394690233|DA
E024|S048|E024-subject2-10|prompt1|2|Hey, Alex! How are you doing?|1643394705363|DA
E024|S048|E024-subject2-11|prompt1|2|Personally, I've been really into Euphoria lately. What kinds of genres are you into? |1643394785187|DA
E024|S047|E024-subject1-3|prompt1|1|Ryan Renolds is indeed alway a plus haha|1643394841474|DA
E024|S047|E024-subject1-4|prompt1|1|Do you like Euphoria a lot? I've heard good things. But was in the middle of a bad breakup when it first came out and was def not in the mindset to watch more than like the first 10 minutes whoops|1643394880817|DA
E024|S048|E024-subject2-12|prompt1|2|I feel like Netflix has a lot of good stuff that fits into that category. The last thriller series I watched was Red Notice and it was pretty cool. Also Ryan Reynolds is always a plus lol|1643394944702|DA
E024|S047|E024-subject1-5|prompt2|1|If you're on HBO and like shows like that, have you seen the new Gossip Girl reboot?|1643394997391|DA

E024|S047|E024-subject1-6|prompt2|1|I would. It's not too related to the og series, basically only in concept of a secret blogger and some pained references.|1643395108470|DA

E024|S047|E024-subject1-7|prompt2|1|Also v pretty and teen drama and lots of VERY attractive people|1643395130454|DA
E024|S048|E024-subject2-15|prompt2|2|I haven't! I didn't even know there was one. Do you recommend it?|1643395199482|DA
E024|S047|E024-subject1-8|prompt2|1|Yes, exactly. Like there's mention of the old characters as background references, but the core set of characters is completely new|1643395304515|DA
E024|S048|E024-subject2-16|prompt2|2|"Ooh okay so it falls under that category of like ""legacy sequels"" that people have been making? Kinda like a spin off/sequel combo ?"|1643395382233|DA
E024|S047|E024-subject1-9|prompt2|1|Oh interesting. I think maybe it all goes back the fact that they're really trying to pander to people's comfort shows rn? But in like sort of an updated way|1643395441279|DA
E024|S048|E024-subject2-17|prompt2|2|"I just saw the new scream movie last night and its the same concept. Pretty good and really meta. It even describes itself as a ""re-quel"" in universe LOL"|1643395522026|DA
E025|S050|E025-subject2-15|prompt1|2|i recommend any of the planet earth documentaries if youre into nature, and they're very relaxing|1643394848287|DA

E025|S049|E025-subject1-6|prompt2|1|If you want something thought-provoking or stimulating, I can't recommend 2021's Pig enough.|1643395282455|DA
E025|S049|E025-subject1-7|prompt2|1|It has Nicholas Cage, and he put in an Oscar worthy performance.|1643395307070|DA
E025|S049|E025-subject1-8|prompt2|1|I couldn't get it out of my head for weeks after I first watched it.|1643395322845|DA

E025|S050|E025-subject2-19|prompt2|2|not the biggest cage fan but i can deal.|1643395348229|DA
E025|S049|E025-subject1-9|prompt2|1|I would also recommend In The Vast Of Night.  It's lesser known, on Amazon Prime.  It's a slow burn Sci-Fi mystery.|1643395407556|DA
E025|S049|E025-subject1-10|prompt2|1|Not a lot happens in this movie, but it's extremely interesting and engaging.|1643395438553|DA

E027|S054|E027-subject2-22|prompt1|2|Hi Alex. It is great that work week is over. What kind of movies do you like?|1643394878869|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-2|prompt1|1|i usually stick to the sci fi/ history movies|1643394905631|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-3|prompt1|1|what about you?|1643394913404|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-23|prompt1|2|I watch just about everything now that streaming has made it so easy to access. The latest Sci-Fi thing I watched was a show called the Expanse on Amazon. Have you heard/seen that?|1643394960885|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-4|prompt1|1|the expanse is probably my favorite show in recent years|1643394993831|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-24|prompt1|2|Wow. I am still finishing up season 6 . I am about halfway through it.|1643395009892|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-5|prompt1|1|it has one of the best plots ive watched|1643395019045|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-6|prompt1|1|nice, have you tried the books?|1643395052206|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-25|prompt1|2|It definitely is an interesting plot. No, I am not much of a book reader. I have tried in the past to go back and read books of shows I liked (Game of Thrones) and I end up losing interest. I heard the books were really good for the Expanse too. It is actually what got me to watch the show.|1643395096886|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-7|prompt1|1|yeah the books are really well done, the audiobooks are also really done well, the reader is great|1643395139988|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-26|prompt1|2|That's a great idea, audiobooks. I need to look into that.|1643395159140|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-8|prompt1|1|nice, what other stuff do you watch, have you tried that wheel of time from amazon?|1643395204604|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-27|prompt1|2|So any show or movie that you are looking to watch this weekend since I imagine you are all caughtup on the Expanse?|1643395207484|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-28|prompt1|2|I normally stick to 1 show at a time and binge watch my way through it. I actually started Expanse last week and watch about 5-6 episodes a day when I get home from work . |1643395246852|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-9|prompt1|1|right now im just waiting for the lord of the rings shows coming i think in september|1643395254132|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-10|prompt1|1|oh, nice, i usually only watch one show at a time as well|1643395280198|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-29|prompt2|2|That's a long time away unfortunately. I know Disney has a few Star-Wars shows coming out but I am not sure if that is sci-fi enough.|1643395299236|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-11|prompt2|1|yeah disney usually misses the mark for me|1643395328497|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-30|prompt2|2|I would agree. While Mandolorian was pretty good, it is sci-fi light in my opinion.|1643395353963|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-12|prompt2|1|agreed|1643395362995|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-13|prompt2|1|i see the prompt has changed, and i have a perfect movie for this one, the man from earth|1643395394887|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-31|prompt2|2|I never heard of that movie. Is it newer?|1643395412219|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-14|prompt2|1|it is about an immortal man from prehistoric times trying to prove he is immortal, its an older movie as well|1643395445335|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-32|prompt2|2|That actually does sound thought-provoking.|1643395457940|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-15|prompt2|1|it takes place in modern day|1643395460983|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-16|prompt2|1|it is one of my favorite movies in while|1643395484552|DA

E027|S054|E027-subject2-34|prompt2|2|"Honestly, I have been on a slump lately finding good movies. It seems like everything is just a rehash of what has been done before. Weirdly enough ""Free Guy"" with Ryan Reynolds was the last movie I enjoyed which I didn't expect to."|1643395573730|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-18|prompt2|1|ill have to check that out, and i agree it feels like newer movies are just repeats|1643395610744|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-35|prompt2|2|It is a good turn off your brain popcorn movie.|1643395631961|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-36|prompt2|2|The opposite of thought-provoking lol.|1643395646298|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-19|prompt2|1|ryan reynolds is a good actor so it probably has something going for it|1643395680681|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-37|prompt2|2|The Expanse is very thought provoking on the other hand. |1643395683698|DA
E027|S054|E027-subject2-38|prompt2|2|I swear The Expanse mirrors some of the issues we face in current day with just using space and distant planets as a medium. |1643395716899|DA
E027|S053|E027-subject1-20|prompt2|1|i agree completely, the writers of that are very skilled|1643395751228|DA

E032|S064|E032-subject2-24|prompt1|2|Howdy Alex. |1643652116814|DA
E032|S063|E032-subject1-2|prompt1|1|Been a rough week at work. Want to watch something new to unwind. What do you think?|1643652138057|DA
E032|S064|E032-subject2-25|prompt1|2|Well- I don't know about you, but I'm a big fan of watching bad movies as a way to unwind. To that extent, may I suggest my favorite movie The Room written, directed and starring Tommy Wiseau?|1643652219020|DA
E032|S063|E032-subject1-3|prompt1|1|I've heard that movie is not the greatest|1643652241851|DA

E032|S063|E032-subject1-4|prompt1|1|OK I didn't want to insult you lol|1643652265990|DA
E032|S064|E032-subject2-27|prompt1|2|There's loads to laugh at from inept dialogue, to bad sets, acting, plot etc.|1643652287458|DA

E032|S064|E032-subject2-30|prompt1|2|Awful in that they're just poorly acted, not the gratuity I mean.|1643652358165|DA
E032|S063|E032-subject1-6|prompt1|1|What about a TV show? I don't think this movie will take me all weekend.|1643652365111|DA
E032|S064|E032-subject2-31|prompt1|2|Well to be honest I don't watch much TV these days. If you're down for something a bit more edgy I'd say give Breaking Bad a watch perhaps? It's one of my favorite shows and it should last you most of the weekend.|1643652469602|DA

E032|S063|E032-subject1-9|prompt2|1|I think it's more of the drug aspect. I think she thinks it glorifies it but I don't necessarily think that's the case.|1643652584581|DA
E032|S064|E032-subject2-33|prompt2|2|Okay so I'm bored lately. Got anything thought provoking or stimulating to throw my way?|1643652602828|DA

E032|S063|E032-subject1-14|prompt2|1|Just watched Don't Look Up on Netflix. That was pretty good. Also depressing but in a different way.|1643652849962|DA

E041|S082|E041-subject2-27|prompt1|2|I think it is one of those movies that either love or hate|1643735440079|DA
E041|S081|E041-subject1-7|prompt1|1|That's true. Do you watch things on Disney or Hulu?|1643735467881|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-28|prompt1|2|Disney, my son likes to watch the old Family Matters show from the late 80's -mid 90s|1643735493296|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-29|prompt1|2|Hulu - I really have only watched the Handmaid's Tale|1643735504452|DA
E041|S081|E041-subject1-8|prompt1|1|Yeah Hulu has good stuff but they don't advertise as much. I liked Only Murders in the Building|1643735546523|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-30|prompt1|2|That sounds interesting.  I don't really even think about Hulu for some reason.  I forget it is there|1643735570990|DA
E041|S081|E041-subject1-9|prompt1|1|Same, I mean a lot of streaming services have good stuff but its expensive|1643735616619|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-31|prompt1|2|To have them all is very pricey for sure|1643735640985|DA

E041|S081|E041-subject1-11|prompt2|1|It's a animation adaptation of a web series of some people's dungeon and dragons campaign|1643735726688|DA
E041|S081|E041-subject1-12|prompt2|1|I don't watch that much animation though|1643735746356|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-34|prompt2|2|That sounds interesting, never watched anything like that|1643735754104|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-35|prompt2|2|Have you seen Raised by wolves on HBO?|1643735764989|DA
E041|S081|E041-subject1-13|prompt2|1|No, that sounds interesting though. What's it about|1643735778011|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-36|prompt2|2|It is about two droids and they are raising these kids on this uninhabited planet to not believe in god and instead rely on themselves.|1643735829369|DA
E041|S081|E041-subject1-14|prompt2|1|That sounds crazy what genre is it|1643735857135|DA

E041|S082|E041-subject2-38|prompt2|2|Is there a genre you don't like? I do not usually watch much Sci-FI.|1643735907184|DA
E041|S081|E041-subject1-16|prompt2|1|I don't really like things that are too complicated like fantasy/sci-fi but for the most part I like almost anything|1643735962276|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-39|prompt2|2|I am not a super-fan of comedies and remakes unless they are really well done|1643736019838|DA
E041|S081|E041-subject1-17|prompt2|1|Yeah the remakes are getting out of hand. It really depends|1643736057268|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-40|prompt2|2|Some are just so stupid, like why ruin it|1643736072639|DA
E041|S081|E041-subject1-18|prompt2|1|And then like they cancel their good original shows|1643736104146|DA
E041|S082|E041-subject2-41|prompt2|2|yeah...I would rather an original idea with people you haven't seen before.  Sometimes that is where you find the diamond.|1643736127744|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-14|prompt1|2|To unwind, I would typically suggest a commedy. Some of my favorites are Friends and the Office. I also like dramas but that could make you more tense, not relaxed|1643735274543|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-1|prompt1|1|"If you like comedy I would recommend that you watch ""smiling friends"". I have recently seen it and though it was pretty funny"|1643735335311|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-15|prompt1|2|I haven't heard of that, what is it about?|1643735346989|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-2|prompt1|1|"Its about an organization called the ""smiling friends"" and their job is to go around and help people find happiness. But they always find themselves in bizarre situations."|1643735410335|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-16|prompt1|2|oh that does sound interesting, is it a new or old show?|1643735429173|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-3|prompt1|1|It is new i believe, released this year|1643735449441|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-17|prompt1|2|is it on a streaming platform?|1643735464184|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-4|prompt1|1|I think you can see it on hulu|1643735491287|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-18|prompt1|2|oh ok. Does it have any popular actors? I enjoy seeing actors I like in tv shows and movies, but it's also refreshing to see something with a completely unknown cast|1643735530842|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-5|prompt1|1|"Popular might be a stretch. It's a cartoon, so it doesn't have actors like ""The Office."" But it is written and animated by Zach Hadel and Michel Cusack, who are fairly famous animators and comedians on youtube."|1643735670335|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-19|prompt2|2|ohhh I see. I'll have to take a look|1643735690682|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-6|prompt2|1|"If you would rather watch something with actors, have you ever seen ""parks and recreation?"""|1643735770520|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-20|prompt2|2|yes!! Not all of it though. It's very funny|1643735781257|DA

E042|S084|E042-subject2-21|prompt2|2|How do you feel about Euphoria|1643735829142|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-8|prompt2|1|I heard of it, but have never seen it myself|1643735869749|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-9|prompt2|1|heard some good things i think.|1643735877364|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-22|prompt2|2|I certainly like it, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. It can also be a bit uncomfortable to watch with other people in the room..|1643735905125|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-23|prompt2|2|I made the mistake of watching the first episode with my brother|1643735914590|DA

E042|S083|E042-subject1-10|prompt2|1|Sounds interesting, what is it about?|1643735938205|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-25|prompt2|2|It's about a group of high schoolers and their lives, but it very prominently features drugs and sex, and some poeple think it glamorizes drug addiction so that's one of the reasons some people don't like it|1643735987241|DA
E042|S084|E042-subject2-26|prompt2|2|It's funny and captivating though|1643736000380|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-11|prompt2|1|I do like to laugh, I don't think drugs and sex in a tv would bother me much.|1643736059942|DA
E042|S083|E042-subject1-12|prompt2|1|I think ill check it out!|1643736071405|DA

E043|S085|E043-subject1-3|prompt1|1|No, is it good?|1643735291044|DA
E043|S086|E043-subject2-47|prompt1|2|Yes! It's funny, cute, original, and deals with deep things like existence without being too cheesy|1643735316961|DA
E043|S085|E043-subject1-4|prompt1|1|"I like sci fi, funny stuff, and uplifting stuff. Nothing too horrible -- but I *did* like ""The Chestnut Man,"" the danish serial killer thing."|1643735319753|DA

E043|S085|E043-subject1-8|prompt1|1|Me too! |1643735403999|DA
E043|S085|E043-subject1-9|prompt1|1|I liked Game of Thrones because of the characters, but I had to close my eyes during the gruesome parts.|1643735425964|DA
E043|S086|E043-subject2-52|prompt1|2|I read all of the game of thrones books but couldnt get into the series|1643735439852|DA

E043|S085|E043-subject1-12|prompt1|1|"It's a good one for me to think about right now, because just today I was feeling down about feeling ""imprisoned"" by our pandemic situation. The idea of focusing on hope and plans rather than despair is a good one."|1643735518167|DA
E043|S086|E043-subject2-55|prompt1|2|I watch it like 4 times a year because it is sooo good and heart wrenching|1643735519901|DA

E043|S085|E043-subject1-15|prompt1|1|I just re-watched the movie Jurassic Park. The book is better. The book has a lot about chaos theory and how situations spin out of control.|1643735607862|DA
E043|S086|E043-subject2-58|prompt1|2|i never read the book|1643735616101|DA

E043|S085|E043-subject1-20|prompt1|1|It was so crazy over the top.|1643735658901|DA
E043|S085|E043-subject1-21|prompt1|1|And yet it too was in a way a metaphor for our real society.|1643735667113|DA

E046|S092|E046-subject2-29|prompt1|2|Godzilla is definitely the granddaddy of Toku. :) If you enjoy Godzilla, look up a show called Kamen Rider Black. It's very fun, very 80s, lots of wild camera action on a small budget.|1643736561474|DA

E046|S092|E046-subject2-41|prompt2|2|If it kills you, then the last person that had it gets chased. It's just like an endless chain of posession.|1643737065368|DA
E046|S092|E046-subject2-42|prompt2|2|"But it's so slow. It's one of those things that you'd think ""oh i can get away from it"" but then it still finds people that move across the globe."|1643737088711|DA

E051|S101|E051-subject1-5|prompt1|1|I love shows that really make you think deeply. I like to speculate on the different hidden messages within shows too. If not an intense show like that though, then I love comedies like The Office and New Girl to keep it light and simple.|1644518146820|DA

E067|S134|E067-subject2-27|prompt1|2|But if you like shows that are more about being outside and surviving, there's that one called Naked and Afraid.  lol|1644948574644|DA

E067|S134|E067-subject2-34|prompt2|2|I like shows like that.  Anything else like that?  I like stuff that's also dark, but not exploitative.  Know what I mean?|1644948943250|DA

E067|S134|E067-subject2-35|prompt2|2|Breaking Bad yes, but Big Sky no.  Is it like Breaking Bad but in Montana? :D|1644949013914|DA

E068|S135|E068-subject1-1|prompt1|1|I'd recommend cartoons such as Adventure Time, Regular Show, Steven Universe, etc. because they are very fun shows with plots adults could get hooked in|1644948652157|DA
E068|S136|E068-subject2-26|prompt1|2|i love cartoons|1644948659806|DA
E068|S136|E068-subject2-27|prompt1|2|haven't seen those though|1644948664187|DA
E068|S135|E068-subject1-2|prompt1|1|yeah imo they're all S-tier, I grew up with Cartoon Network and it's got some really good shows (and the occasional not so good show too lol)|1644948691718|DA
E068|S135|E068-subject1-3|prompt1|1|I don't really watch any movies so I don't think I really have any recommendations there|1644948712229|DA
E068|S136|E068-subject2-28|prompt1|2|i see|1644948730063|DA
E068|S136|E068-subject2-29|prompt1|2|that's interesting|1644948733679|DA
E068|S135|E068-subject1-4|prompt1|1|also if you have Netflix, The Good Place is a great show|1644948743430|DA
E068|S136|E068-subject2-30|prompt1|2|i have netflix but i haven't heard of that|1644948757089|DA
E068|S136|E068-subject2-31|prompt1|2|what's it about?|1644948759763|DA
E068|S135|E068-subject1-5|prompt1|1|it's about a woman who dies young (probly in her 20s) and wakes up being told there's an afterlife and she made it into heaven but she realizes she doesn't actually belong there/some mistake was made and she has to keep her mouth shut so they don't find out their error and send her to the bad place|1644948805487|DA

E071|S142|E071-subject2-32|prompt1|2|Hey Alex|1644947011390|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-33|prompt1|2|Pat here|1644947013333|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-1|prompt1|1|Hi|1644947029524|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-34|prompt1|2|What's your most recent favorite show?|1644947042089|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-2|prompt1|1|Succession was very good!|1644947064423|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-3|prompt1|1|I would say that's one of the better shows I've watched recently|1644947075303|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-35|prompt1|2|I haven't seen it! Just looked it up real quick - looks like a drama?|1644947095060|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-4|prompt1|1|Yup, sort of a corporate drama, its on HBO, just finished its 3rd season, so there's plenty to binge watch |1644947119824|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-36|prompt1|2|nice, I'm actually gonna have to check that out haha - is that your general style of show that you like? |1644947155092|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-5|prompt1|1|I think I like a lot of different stuff, but HBO is usually on the money w/ their shows |1644947182997|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-6|prompt1|1|Sopranos, The Wire, etc |1644947188293|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-37|prompt1|2|they did GoT, right?|1644947189846|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-7|prompt1|1|correct |1644947193843|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-8|prompt1|1|I liked that as well|1644947204724|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-38|prompt1|2|Oh man, they did all those too? The wire was awesome - I keep meaning to rewatch it, but it hit too hard haha|1644947212686|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-9|prompt1|1|Yeah some of those shows are so good that you can rewatch them every few years. Sopranos is my favorite of all time |1644947240550|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-39|prompt1|2|Who did Mad Men, AMC?|1644947252080|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-10|prompt1|1|Yup|1644947259794|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-11|prompt1|1|AMC's got a few good ones too, Mad Men, Breaking Bad |1644947269937|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-40|prompt1|2|Mad men was great, it was one of the few series I've watched a few times through - I'm not at all like Draper, but the family plots really got me|1644947305984|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-12|prompt1|1|Yeah, upon rewatching, he's sort of a terrible person from the jump|1644947332422|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-13|prompt1|1|but a great period drama |1644947348391|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-41|prompt1|2|So I'm trying to recommend some movies or shows here for you to unwind, but I'm afraid you may have seen anything I can recommend - what about other dramas like you'd see on Netflix, like the Crown? Familiar with it?|1644947358565|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-14|prompt1|1|I have not seen it, but heard its great|1644947376371|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-15|prompt1|1|I'll check that out|1644947407468|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-42|prompt1|2|Ok there's one - it's incredibly worth it, very tight, very fun, and because it's (pseudo) real, it really wraps you up|1644947416330|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-16|prompt1|1|what about Downton Abbey, is that worth watching?|1644947432861|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-43|prompt2|2|I LOVED the first season or two, watched them several times - fantastic. But then I felt the show writers kind of went off the rails with trying to make it interesting.|1644947473395|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-17|prompt2|1|That seems to be a common problem |1644947487901|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-18|prompt2|1|like how GoT was great until they fumbled at the last minute|1644947499962|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-44|prompt2|2|Yeah. Milking it a bit long, or trying to be interesting for interesting's sake|1644947504385|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-45|prompt2|2|"THAT WAS MY EXACT THOUGHT JUST NOW - I can't get invested if you insist on killing every character for ""shock"" value or whatever"|1644947526441|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-46|prompt2|2|by GoT season 5 or 6, I was wondering, why do I care about these characters anymore?|1644947552769|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-47|prompt2|2|Ope Alex, looks like you have the new prompt|1644947571938|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-19|prompt2|1|Well, based on what you've told me , I would recommend Sopranos, as it sort of set the template for the anti hero, prestige drama that is now so popular |1644947625149|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-20|prompt2|1|Everything from Mad men, sons of anarchy, breaking bad, etc. owes its lineage to that |1644947646956|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-48|prompt2|2|I've never watched it - it seems to be almost Shakespeare level of referencing in pop-culture... I could get something from it|1644947689555|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-49|prompt2|2|were you ok with the ending? (I'm not familiar with it, just want to know if I'll be let down haha)|1644947704617|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-21|prompt2|1|Honestly, people were pissed at the time, but it aged well in my opinion, and is in keeping w/ the show's overall theme |1644947730277|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-22|prompt2|1|its not a bad ending like GoT was |1644947735711|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-23|prompt2|1|where the writers just said fuck it, we're already working on a different show|1644947746792|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-50|prompt2|2|I recently watched Seinfeld for the first time and after hearing about how bad that ending was supposed to be, I was actually ok with it|1644947756075|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-24|prompt2|1|I'm working on seinfeld now as well|1644947765707|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-25|prompt2|1|lot of references from my parent's generation now make sense |1644947777221|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-51|prompt2|2|I think Mad Men and Breaking Bad both did endings really well (though BB was meh for a bit there near the end)|1644947780732|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-52|prompt2|2|re: references, yes, everything makes so much more sense now...|1644947794110|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-26|prompt2|1|I think HBO does a good job of using a certain setting/ motif as a vehicle for all sorts of discussion and exploration|1644947826629|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-27|prompt2|1|so the Sopranos is obviously a violent mob drama on the surface|1644947839330|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-53|prompt2|2|ooh, wait, they did Chernobyl too right? I heard that was pretty mcuh one of the best shows made in the last decade|1644947855053|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-28|prompt2|1|I loved Chernobyl |1644947866265|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-54|prompt2|2|... I need to get an HBO subscription...|1644947876117|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-29|prompt2|1|I would say its more worth it than netflix, honestly |1644947893878|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-30|prompt2|1|as far as the deep library of TV that they permanently own|1644947901745|DA
E071|S141|E071-subject1-31|prompt2|1|whereas netflix is mostly just temporarily licensing expensive properties that eventually go away|1644947914377|DA
E071|S142|E071-subject2-55|prompt2|2|I think ATT owns them for now too, so maybe I can get that with my internet now... hmmm, will check|1644947926166|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-22|prompt1|2|"I would recommend the shows ""You"" and ""Dark"" on Netflix. I think they are both very entertaining and worth sinking  a bunch of  time into. "|1644947058687|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-1|prompt1|1|I haven't seen You but I loved Dark!|1644947076078|DA

E072|S144|E072-subject2-24|prompt1|2|I haven't seen that show|1644947203437|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-5|prompt1|1|friends reccomended Yellowjackets but I haven't seen it yet. it sounds intense.|1644947210191|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-25|prompt1|2|What is that  about |1644947218921|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-6|prompt1|1|I just finished The Expanse, it|1644947228841|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-26|prompt1|2|I started The Expanse and got kinda bored after the first episode. Is  it  worth continuing?|1644947252992|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-7|prompt1|1|has a lot of world building but I loved it. the characters are amazing.|1644947255842|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-27|prompt1|2|I should try that one|1644947272519|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-8|prompt1|1|I found it worthwhile.|1644947281269|DA

E072|S144|E072-subject2-30|prompt1|2|I like the horror genre. I like a lot of asian horror films. My favorite is A Tale of Two Sisters|1644947421750|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-12|prompt1|1|I havent seen that and I have to be careful about horror, what do you like about A Tale of Two Sisters?|1644947467102|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-13|prompt2|1|have you seen Midsommar?|1644947527472|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-31|prompt2|2|Honestly, the most thought provoking and interesting show I've watched is the one I mentioned earlier, Dark. I can't beat that one. But the OA is another  one of my favorite shows |1644947544040|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-32|prompt2|2|I've seen Midsommar. I liked  it. Probably wouldn't be in my top tens list though |1644947563041|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-33|prompt2|2|Most horror movies are the same. Same plot |1644947578386|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-14|prompt2|1|okay! yeah I didn't watch the last season of OA but the first season made me ugly cry|1644947595027|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-34|prompt2|2|The second season is even better. Would definitely recommend you giving that one a watch. I was very sad when it was canceled. The plot was getting so interesting. It had so much potential|1644947650737|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-15|prompt2|1|I will check it out!|1644947671555|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-35|prompt2|2|What show would you recommend over all others?|1644947690505|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-16|prompt2|1|I don't know about over all others but I just finished Archive 81 and it was pretty okay|1644947757452|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-17|prompt2|1|I mean I also agree with you that Dark is great|1644947796354|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-36|prompt2|2|Oh, I've also been watching Star Trek Discovery. I thought it was pretty good and that isn't normally a genre I'm interested in|1644947842902|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-18|prompt2|1|I really liked Russian Doll and am hoping the second season comes out eventually|1644947846325|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-37|prompt2|2|YES. That one was good|1644947851689|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-38|prompt2|2|I thought they would've come out with a second season by now|1644947864040|DA

E072|S144|E072-subject2-39|prompt2|2|What's the best one? I'm excited to watch the new show with Spock and Captain Pike|1644947898727|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-20|prompt2|1|another show I can'|1644947900046|DA
E072|S143|E072-subject1-21|prompt2|1|t get enough of is Sex Education but I can't tell if you would like it?|1644947927507|DA
E072|S144|E072-subject2-40|prompt3|2|I've thought about it, if its good I'll try it out|1644947960360|DA
E073|S145|E073-subject1-1|prompt1|1|I like action thrillers, comedies, historical fiction. But they have to be believable without too many plot holes or I lose interest.|1644947105763|DA
E073|S145|E073-subject1-2|prompt1|1|Yeah, I hate sci-fi.|1644947172732|DA
E073|S145|E073-subject1-3|prompt1|1|It should have a pretty good plot twist too in order to keep me guessing.|1644947197514|DA
E073|S145|E073-subject1-4|prompt1|1|I liked the new Reacher series on Amazon, though I think the books are better.|1644947219437|DA
E073|S145|E073-subject1-5|prompt1|1|Yeah, not a fan of either of those. Real life provides enough horror and what you see on the screen doesn't frighten me at all.|1644947256740|DA
E073|S145|E073-subject1-6|prompt1|1|I enjoyed Barry.|1644947270060|DA

E092|S184|E092-subject2-28|prompt1|2|Oh that totally makes sense. I am all about movies/tv shows that make me relax. The last thing I want after a stressful or long day is to come home and watch something sad or too crazy.|1644340418718|DA

E101|S202|E101-subject2-22|prompt1|2|But it's a true story, happened right by me! |1644429004841|DA
E101|S201|E101-subject1-5|prompt1|1|Oh wow! That is very interesting. I'll have to see it|1644429014202|DA
E101|S202|E101-subject2-23|prompt1|2|Also if you like horror, the Haunting of Hill House is really good. That same director did three total series and I believe they're all on Netflix.|1644429065402|DA
E101|S202|E101-subject2-24|prompt1|2|Definitely suggest those, it's more psychological horror|1644429082024|DA
E101|S201|E101-subject1-6|prompt1|1|I watched a few episodes of Haunting of Hill House and it was very eerie. I didn't finish it, but I heard it is well-worth it.|1644429121404|DA

E101|S202|E101-subject2-31|prompt2|2|Is that the one about the Royal family?|1644429381430|DA
E101|S201|E101-subject1-10|prompt2|1|It is a very interesting show that is essentially about the royal family with Queen Elizabeth and Princess Diana, but it shows the more sensitive and personal side of the family.|1644429397026|DA
E101|S201|E101-subject1-11|prompt2|1|It goes in depth into their lives, more than what the public sees.|1644429423568|DA
E101|S202|E101-subject2-32|prompt2|2|Ah I watched a cool series about Diana on CNN, I really wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. It was super interesting though!|1644429437561|DA
E101|S201|E101-subject1-12|prompt2|1|I was pleasantly surprised watching The Crown too. I don't have that much of an interest in the royal family, but it was interesting to see that side of them.|1644429472125|DA
E101|S202|E101-subject2-33|prompt2|2|I've always felt that way too, I never understood the appeal. Diana's life was surprisingly interesting. I will definitely have to check that out|1644429524300|DA
E101|S202|E101-subject2-34|prompt2|2|Wasn't there a bunch of drama over the show? Like the Queen wasn't happy with it?|1644429539644|DA
E101|S201|E101-subject1-13|prompt2|1|I heard it was a little bit of both, like she enjoyed watching it and then also disliked how some of the characters (including herself) were portrayed|1644429568142|DA
E101|S202|E101-subject2-35|prompt2|2|Oh, I didn't realize that. I thought she felt they didn't portray her well. |1644429612139|DA
E101|S201|E101-subject1-14|prompt2|1|I think that is what happened. In the show she was super mean to Princess Diana and other people. Maybe she didn't like the show revealing her in a bad light.|1644429652072|DA
E101|S202|E101-subject2-36|prompt2|2|Our time is almost up. Thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to check out The Crown, for sure|1644429668627|DA

E102|S204|E102-subject2-47|prompt1|2|It's a tv show that is a mock-umentary about vampires living together in a big house|1644429883758|DA
E102|S204|E102-subject2-48|prompt1|2|the writers are very funny - the show is based off of a movie with the same title (the movie is MUCH better, and WAY funnier) but the show is good too|1644429918925|DA
